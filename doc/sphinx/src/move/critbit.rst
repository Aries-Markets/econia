.. Note that some auto-generated links require doing a find and replace
  all from 'CritBit.md#' to 'critbit.html#' within the generated .md
  file. Additionally, drop-down implementation elements do not wrap
  properly, and links to included external modules (like Std::Vector) do
  not render properly
